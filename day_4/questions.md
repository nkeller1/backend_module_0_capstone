## Day 4 Questions

1. In your own words, what is the purpose of a method?

`In short. to save time. You can use a method to execute a piece of code over and over
without having to write the code over and over.`

1. In the space below, create a method named `hello` that will print `"Sam I am"`.

`def hello
  puts "Sam I am."
end

puts hello`

1. Create a method name `hello_someone` that takes an argument of `name` and prints `"#{name} I am"`.

`def hello_someone(name)
  puts "#{name} I am"
end

hello_someone("Nate")`

1. How would you call or execute the method that you created above?

`see above. I defined name as 'Nate' below end.`

1. What questions do you still have about methods in Ruby?

`I am still confused about why return values exist. There is a lot of importance stressed
in the lessons about this but, even are reading a few supporting articles, don't
really understand why they are needed besides to make the code 'cleaner'.`
