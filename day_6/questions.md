## Day 5 Questions

1. In your own words, what is a Class?

`A class is a category of a specific object. It is the idea of the abstract concept of an object.`

1. In relation to a Class, what is an attribute?

`An attribute is the 'things' that make up the class. The nuts and bolts of the class. These nuts and bolts hold information.`

1. In relation to a Class, what is behavior?

`Behaviors are the methods. The things that act upon the attributes that either change the attributes or display information about the attribute. These are the actions the class, and more specifically, the attributes can take.`

1. What questions do you still have about classes in Ruby?

`I am good with the 'idea' of classes. There are a lot of code commands to work through here though. I need more practice on these. For example, getter and setter methods. When and how to use them and when and how to use only a getter or only a setter. and why.`
